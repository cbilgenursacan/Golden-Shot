# Golden Shot
Java based 2d game In this game the goal is shoot the worms with your golden eggs. Be careful about the cats if you intersect with a cat you will lose a heart. You can hit the cats too but be careful since you can only shoot 3 eggs in a row. The chicken can refill its hearts by directly intersect with a heart. As the level goes up the cats will be produced more rapidly and move faster. There is only 3 levels available now so the goal is making the best score possible. Enjoy!
